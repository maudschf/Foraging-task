# Foraging-task

Here we load our codes to do analyzes (or acquisitions) regarding the shared foraging task. 
To do so : retrieve the files you need in the main branch/folder to do your tests. Create a new python file (or change the name of the file you've retrieved) to call it "Tests_name" (change with your own name) and add this file in the "Tests" folder. Once it's done, you can commit your changes into your test file everytime you need. That will allow other contributors to see what you are doing, how you did it etc. It allows us to avoid doing same analysis and to access to other's methods of coding. 

Common objective: optimize those codes, test our analyzes and get rid of them after. 

Good to know : Thomas already created an optimized version of the analysis code in another github. You can check what he has changed if you want but it is easier to start with previous codes from Alice and incorporate your corrections in his version after. Here is the link to the github : https://github.com/HeathenToaster/MouseTache
Only Maud and Thomas can access to this git. If you think you have all figures you wanted etc, please notify Maud so she can add these changes in Thomas' git.
