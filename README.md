# Foraging-task

Here we load our codes to do analyzes (or acquisitions) regarding the shared foraging task. 
Objective: optimize those codes and get rid of them after. 

Good to know : Thomas already created an optimized version of this code in another github. You can check what he has changed if you want but it might be easier to start with previous codes from Alice and incorporate your corrections in his version. 
Here is the link to the github : https://github.com/HeathenToaster/MouseTache
